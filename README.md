# BTEC Overall Grade Calculator

This is a web site to help learners easily understand their predicted or achieved overall BTEC (NQF) Level 2 grade. It will allow the user to select the relevant sector and qualification size they have studied. 

It relies on PHP pulling data from a MySQL database. It is based on my Excel version of this calculator http://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/btec-brand/deliver-btec/BTEC_NQF_Grade_Calculator_updated.xlsm.
